                <p>This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how the Fashion DAO

                <h1>SCOPE</h1>
                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by us, including on
                    our website located at fshntoken.com (the “Site”). To make this Privacy Policy
                    easier to read, our Site and the content and functionalities accessible via the
                    Site are collectively referred to as the “Site.” For the avoidance of doubt, this
                    Privacy Policy does not apply to the decentralized digital ecosystem developed by
                    the Fashion DAO (the “Protocol”) and the Fashion DAO cannot control activity and
                    data on the Protocol, the validation of transactions on the Protocol, or use of
                    the Protocol. The Protocol is an open-source protocol that is maintained and
                    processed by validators across the globe.
                </p>

                    there are any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you as
                    required by applicable law. You understand and agree that you will be deemed to
