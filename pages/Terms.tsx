                <p>Last Updated: May 18, 2022</p>

                <p>
                    Please read these Terms of Use (the “Terms”) and our Privacy Policy
                    (“Privacy Policy”) carefully because they govern your use of the website
                    located at fshntoken.com and the content and functionalities accessible via the
                    Site (collectively, the “Site”) offered by the Fashion DAO (“Fashion DAO”), a
                    Cayman Islands foundation limited by guarantee and without share capital.
                    The Fashion DAO maintains the Site as a portal for information, news and updates
                    about the decentralized digital ecosystem utilizing units of value denominated
                    as “FSHN Tokens.” For the avoidance of doubt, the Fashion DAO does not control
                    the blockchain on which Fashion Tokens are tradable or useable (the “Protocol”)
                    and cannot control activity and data on the Protocol, the validation of transactions
                    on the Protocol, or use of the Protocol. The Protocol is an open-source protocol
                    that is maintained and processed by validators across the globe.
